Largest prime factor

Problem 3
The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

My Approach?
> Initially, create a list of ptime numbers using Sieve of Eranthoses.
>> That can be done in different ways, including dictionary, list of dictionaries and set.
>> I'll try with a set approach. N.B. Set is not subscriptable, but can be iterated through. (for s in my_set: ...)
>> Also, cannot remove from set whilst iterating over it!

> Going through a tree needs while True: ...
>> However, this comes after for p in primes # <= that caused me a lot of grief/time!


Enhanced approach:
Step 1:
> Find a whole number nearly greater than the square root of A.
K ¿ square root(A)
Step 2:
> Test whether A is divisible by any prime number less than K.
If yes A is not a prime number. If not, A is prime number.
